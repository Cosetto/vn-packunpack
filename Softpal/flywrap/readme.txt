flywrap

reads a script file in extracted softpal format and warns about lines that are
long and needs linebreak, and suggests where to put them (shown as "____").
supports different font sizes (but the user might have to supply line lengths
for some font sizes)

works on flyable heart since it has monospaced font. other games might use a
proportional font, this tool won't work in those cases
