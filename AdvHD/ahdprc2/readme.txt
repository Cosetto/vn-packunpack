fork of ahdprc
https://github.com/Inori/FuckGalEngine/tree/master/AdvHD/ahdprc

- codepage stuff changed to 932 (japanese shift-jis)
- character messagetype changed to %LF to support miazora interstellar focus
  (for games that use %LC, use the original ahdprc or change all occurrences
  of %LF in this version to %LC)
