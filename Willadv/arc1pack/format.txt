file format:

offset	length	content
0	4	number of file type headers (little endian)
4	0xc	file type header 1
10	0xc	file type header 2 (if it exists)


file type header format (length 0xc)
offset	length
0	4	null-terminated file type (WSC, PNG, OGG, MSK, TBL, WIP, ANM)
		in alphabetical order i guess
4	4	number of files of that type
8	4	offset in archive file to start of directory header

directory header entry (length 0x15)
offset	length
0	0xd	null-terminated filename
0xd	4	filelength
0x11	4	offset in archive file to start of file

the file contents are byte-rotated left by 2 ((b<<2)|(b>>6))
